# Ticket Management and Assignment System

This ticket management system is designed to efficiently manage support and service requests in an enterprise with multiple user roles. The platform allows administrators to assign tickets to attendees, monitor ticket progress, and provide seamless communication between users, attendees and administrators through an integrated chat.



## Features

- Ticket assignment: administrators can assign tickets to attendees as needed. Tickets can also be reassigned or canceled based on the current status of the request.
- Chat system: A real-time chat allows direct communication between users, attendees and administrators, facilitating problem resolution.
- Interactive modalities: The main views of the system have been optimized to use modals, which improves visualization and facilitates interaction without the need to reload the page.
- Modern and responsive interface: The system uses Bootstrap 5.3.3 to ensure that the interface is modern, clean and fully responsive on different devices.
- Real-time ticket management: Real-time tracking of ticket status and ticket assignments.  
- PDF generation: Allows filtering tickets and generating detailed reports in PDF format, facilitating the tracking and recording of assigned and resolved tickets.
- Customizable user profile: All users can update their profile with limited personal information, improving personalization within the system.
- Optimization of routes and controllers: The internal logic of the system has been optimized, eliminating unnecessary routes and views, improving overall system performance.
- Detailed ticket status control: The logic for ticket assignment is highly optimized to control which tickets can be assigned, reassigned or canceled based on context.
- Advanced administration menu: The administration menu allows efficient management of tickets, users and assignments, with a streamlined interface for easy navigation between functions.
- Role-based access control: The system allows differentiated management of access and permissions according to role (user, assistant, administrator), improving security and control over functionalities.
- Ticket history and tracking: Records interactions, assignments, and status changes for each ticket, providing a complete history of the activities related to each request.
- JavaScript optimization: Intensive use of JavaScript to improve system interactivity, including dynamic updating of modals, forms and view behavior, reducing the need for page reloads.
